# GoogleSheets-to-GoogleForms-app
 A NodeJS app converting Google Sheet document to Google Form

## About
 This is my educational work dedicated to relationship between Google Cloud documents (exactly, Google Sheets and Forms) and NodeJS application.
 
## Run
 To launch this app you need node framework installed on your computer (and npm; link to see and download: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)) and also a Google Account and a Google Cloud project (see: [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)).
 
 To run that repository app open console and enter following command:
 ```
   project-root-directory> node index.js <your Google Sheet ID>
 ```
 
 Don't forget about *Google Sheet ID* that you can find after creating a sheet document in Google Cloud *in url*:
